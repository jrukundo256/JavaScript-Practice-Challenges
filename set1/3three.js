// Code Challenges (Set 1)
// Question (3)

// Write a function named twoSum which takes two parameters: nums
// and target. Given an array of integers nums and an integer target,
// return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.
// You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and
// you may not use the same element twice.

// You can return the answer in any order.
